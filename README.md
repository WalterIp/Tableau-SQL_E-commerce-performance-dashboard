## Purpose of the Project
The beneficial stakeholders would be the potential investors who own or will purchase a property in Washington and plan to list it on Airbnb. 
With the dashboard, some of their concerns could be addressed before the investment:
- How much should I expect to list my property? (by checking the price range/ mean price) 
- How many competitors are around/ similar to my property? (by checking the number of competitors)
- How many minimum and maximum nights should I expect to set for my property? (by checking the percentage of the max & min nights)
- How many of my competitors are superhost? (by checking the superhost rate)
- What are the average review scores for my competitors and location scores for my property? (by checking the average scores for each)
